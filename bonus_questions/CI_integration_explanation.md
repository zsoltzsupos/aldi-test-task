### **Integrating Tests into a CI Pipeline (I used Jenkins before)**

The goal is to automatically run your tests every time a developer changes the code, giving you instant feedback.  
Hereâ€™s the simple, automated process:

1. **Code Change:** A developer pushes new code to a central repository (like GitHub).  
2. **Trigger:** GitHub automatically notifies your CI server, **Jenkins**.  
3. **Jenkins Wakes Up:** Jenkins starts a new "build job" and does the following:  
   * **Gets the Code:** It downloads the latest code change.  
   * **Builds the App:** It compiles the application.  
   * **Runs Fast Tests:** It first runs quick **unit tests**. If any fail, the process stops immediately.  
4. **Set Up for UI Tests:** If the fast tests pass, Jenkins prepares the environment for your Selenium tests. The best way to do this is with **Docker**:  
   * It starts a container for your **application**.  
   * It starts containers for the **web browsers** (e.g., a Selenium Grid).  
5. **Run Selenium Tests:** Jenkins runs your full Selenium test suite against the application and browser containers.  
6. **Report Results:**  
   * Jenkins collects the test results.  
   * It marks the build as **SUCCESS** or **FAILURE**.  
   * It sends a notification to the team (e.g., via Slack or email).  
7. **Clean Up:** Jenkins automatically shuts down and removes the Docker containers, leaving the system clean for the next run.

This entire process turns your tests into an automated safety net that catches bugs early and ensures that no bad code gets through.
